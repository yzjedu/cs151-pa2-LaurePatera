### Algorithm:
1. Import random module
2. Initialize variables and set equal to 0
   >3. player_1_loss
   >4. player_2_loss 
   >5. player_3_loss
3. Output to the user, "This program is a game of pick-up sticks played between two users and a computer. Each player picks up a certain number of sticks from a pile on the table, and whoever picks up the last stick loses."
4. Create the variable stick_number and set it equal to the user input given after asking, "How many sticks do you want on the table? You can choose any number as an integer between 10 and 100."

5. while stick_number is less than 10 or greater than 100
   6. Create the variable stick_number and set it equal to the user input given after asking, "How many sticks do you want on the table? You can choose any number as an integer between 10 and 100."
6. While stick_number is greater than 0
   7. Create the variable player_1_sticks and set it equal to the user input given after asking, "Player 1, how many sticks would you like to take, from 1-3?"
