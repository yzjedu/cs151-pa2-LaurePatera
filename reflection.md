### Objective:
I practiced using looping, decision-making, and error-checking in a large program that would allow users to play the stick game with a computer.


### Procedure:
First, I took time to read the readme.file very carefully, and split the problem up into what I saw as logical steps. I followed the idea of iterative programming, and made parts of the initial design for the algorithm one at a time, until I was finished. After receiving feedback, I created my final design of the algorithm, and then my flowchart. I had to change both of them a lot along the way as I caught errors in my code, but it gave me a lot of practice seeing what would work and what wouldn't. Understanding the organization of nested if/else and while statements was a concept that I explored the most.


### Results:
My results matched what I expected to get, but only after a long amount of time spent testing my program and changing code if it did not work as I initially hoped. I used many test_cases, and although it was difficult, they were very helpful to find and fix errors in my code

### Reflection:

The main challenge I encountered was organizing my code correctly so that no errors appeared and so that my code was human-readable. I had to play around with it quite a bit and trouble-shoot, but it worked out in the end. I tried to make my code as human-readable as possible by including comments and following good programming practices, even though my code was very long. I made an algorithm first to test everything, and then used testing to triple-check my program and follow the rules of programming. My key takeaway is to always spend the time to make sure that your algorithm works and makes sense, because it will save you time in the long run when you are coding. I think I learned what I was supposed to for this lab. It was nice working by myself, but alsp challenging because I could not use another person's perspective to help me see where and when I went wrong.
